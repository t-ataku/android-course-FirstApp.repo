## Prerequisite

This course expects you already know about
* kotlin language
  It doesn't mean you can't read this course, even if you are not familiar with kotlin.
  It simply says nothing will be described in it.
  If you so, you might need to consult another course.
* Event handler in GUI element
  Like other window system, it uses event handling mechanisms for each GUI element such as Button.
  Although it was difficult point for me in my days, but I can't
  explain it well.
  So, if you aren't familier with it, you might need to learn event
  handling in window system before starting the course.
  Also, I request you not to expect the following topics:
* GUI design
  You never know about it in the course.
  In addition, never ask me about the topic.
  I may not provide any information for you.
